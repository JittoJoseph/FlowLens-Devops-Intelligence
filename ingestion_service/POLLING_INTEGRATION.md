# Ingestion Service Updates - Summary

## Changes Made to `index.js`

### âœ… 1. Removed All Trigger Logic

- **Removed**: All `trigger.sql` application logic from `ensureSchemaExists()` function
- **Why**: Migrated from trigger-based to polling-based architecture
- **Impact**: Cleaner startup, no dependency on database triggers

### âœ… 2. Added `processed = FALSE` to All Database Operations

#### `upsertPullRequest()` Function:

- **Added**: `processed` column to INSERT statement with `FALSE` value
- **Added**: `processed = FALSE` to UPDATE (ON CONFLICT) clause
- **Result**: Every PR insert/update will trigger API service polling

#### `upsertPipelineRun()` Function:

- **Added**: `processed` column to INSERT statement with `FALSE` value
- **Added**: `processed = FALSE` to UPDATE (ON CONFLICT) clause
- **Result**: Every pipeline run insert/update will trigger API service polling

#### `updatePipelineStatus()` Function:

- **Added**: `processed = FALSE` to UPDATE query when status changes
- **Result**: Every pipeline status change will trigger API service polling

#### `updatePRStateHistory()` Function:

- **Added**: `processed = FALSE` to UPDATE query when PR history changes
- **Result**: Every PR state change will trigger API service polling

#### PR History Updates in `upsertPullRequest()`:

- **Added**: `processed = FALSE` to the separate history update query
- **Result**: Ensures history additions also trigger polling

## Integration with API Service

### Polling Detection:

- **API Service** polls every 2 seconds for records where `processed = FALSE`
- **Ingestion Service** sets `processed = FALSE` on every state change
- **Result**: Real-time detection of all GitHub webhook events

### State Change Flow:

1. **GitHub Webhook** â†’ **Ingestion Service**
2. **Database Update** with `processed = FALSE`
3. **API Service Polling** detects unprocessed records
4. **Event Processing** (AI insights, WebSocket broadcast)
5. **Mark as Processed** (`processed = TRUE`)

## Benefits of New Architecture

### âœ… Reliability:

- No dependency on database triggers
- Guaranteed event detection through polling
- Handles database reconnections gracefully

### âœ… Performance:

- 2-second polling interval for near real-time updates
- Efficient queries with `processed` index
- No trigger overhead on database operations

### âœ… Debugging:

- Clear audit trail with `processed` flags
- Easy to see unprocessed events
- Simple to reprocess events by setting `processed = FALSE`

### âœ… Scalability:

- Can run multiple API service instances
- Polling-based approach handles high webhook volumes
- No trigger contention issues

## Testing the Integration

### Verify Processing Flow:

1. **Trigger GitHub Event** (create PR, approve, merge)
2. **Check Database**: Verify `processed = FALSE` after ingestion
3. **Wait 2 seconds**: API service should detect and process
4. **Check Database**: Verify `processed = TRUE` after processing
5. **Check WebSocket**: Flutter app should receive state update

### Key Database Queries:

```sql
-- Check unprocessed records
SELECT * FROM pull_requests WHERE processed = FALSE;
SELECT * FROM pipeline_runs WHERE processed = FALSE;
SELECT * FROM insights WHERE processed = FALSE;

-- Monitor processing activity
SELECT pr_number, state, processed, updated_at
FROM pull_requests
ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The ingestion service is now fully compatible with the polling-based API service architecture. Every GitHub webhook event will:

1. **Update database** with new state
2. **Set processed = FALSE** to trigger detection
3. **Get picked up** by API service polling
4. **Generate insights** and broadcast WebSocket updates
5. **Provide real-time** Flutter app updates

The system is now more reliable, debuggable, and ready for production! ðŸš€
